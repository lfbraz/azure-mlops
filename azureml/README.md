# Azure MLOps - Release Pipeline
In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to configure Azure DevOps to create an MLOps Release Pipeline using models created in Azure Machine Learning. In this example, we will deploy two endpoints that consume an already trained model registered in an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

## Create MLOps Release Pipelines using [Azure Devops](https://dev.azure.com/) and [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/pt-br/services/machine-learning/)

First of all, install [Azure ML Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml&targetId=09d19ee8-b94a-4f99-a763-11cc0fe1a111&utm_source=vstsproduct&utm_medium=ExtHubManageList) in your Azure Devops organization:  

![Azure ML Template](images/azureml-template.PNG?raw=true)

Now you will have to set up a service connection. In the [Marketplace Template Home](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml&targetId=09d19ee8-b94a-4f99-a763-11cc0fe1a111&utm_source=vstsproduct&utm_medium=ExtHubManageList) you can see some instructions about how to complete this task.

With the service connection we are able to create a new [Release Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/?view=azure-devops) (in your *Azure Devops project*) to deploy Azure ML models:

In our case we have an Azure DevOps project named **MLOps-LAB**, please feel free to use your own Azure DevOps project.

Now we will add the model artifacts. We will use two sources: A **Repository source** (can be *Azure DevOps Repos, Github*, etc.) and an **Azure ML Model Artifact** (the model you have registered in your Azure ML Workspace):

![Artifacts](images/artifacts.PNG?raw=true)

The **Repository source** will contain your deployment configs (`aciDeploymentConfig.yml` or `aksDeploymentConfig.yml`, `conda_env_v_1_0_0.yml`, `inferenceConfig.yml` and `score.py`). In this [folder](https://github.com/lfbraz/azure-mlops/tree/master/azureml/config) we have some examples of these files.  

In the **Azure ML Model Artifact** we will connect the Azure DevOps with our Azure ML Workspace using the `Service Connection` we created before:

![AzureML Artifact](images/add-azureml-artifact.jpg?raw=true)

Now with the artifacts configured we can add the stages of this Release Pipeline. In this example we will create two stages: **QA** (pre-production) and **Production**:

![Stages](images/stages.PNG?raw=true)

In each stage we will configure an **Azure ML Model Deploy Task** using the `aciDeploymentConfig.yml` (for QA) or `aksDeploymentConfig.yml` (for production) config, and the `inferenceConfig.yml` file as well:

![Deploy Config](images/azureml-deploy-task.PNG?raw=true)

Finally, we can add a Pre-deployment condition to be able to request approval before deploying to **Production** stage. It is useful to validate the **QA** endpoint before putting it on **Production**.

Click on:
![Add Pre-Deployment condition](images/add-pre-deployment-condition.PNG?raw=true)

To open the options to define one (or many) approvers:

![Pre-Deployment condition config](images/pre-deployment-condition-config.PNG?raw=true)

All set up ðŸ˜ƒ. Now we can create a manual **Release**:

![Create Release](images/create-release.PNG?raw=true)

We can use a **Continuous deployment trigger** as well to create a new release every time a new AzureML model is registered: 

![Continuous deployment trigger](images/continuous-deployment.PNG?raw=true)

When a new version of the model is registered in the Azure ML Workspace a new Release will be trigger:

![New model](images/new-registered-model.PNG?raw=true)

![Release QA](images/release-qa.PNG?raw=true)

![Waiting for approval](images/waiting-for-approval.PNG?raw=true)

After the deployed succeded the approver will receive an email similar with this:

![Approval notification](images/approver-notification.PNG?raw=true)

![OK to production](images/approval-OK.PNG?raw=true)

After the approval, the next stage **(deploy to Production)** will be triggered:

![production](images/release-prod.PNG?raw=true)

When all the stages are completed we can see the **endpoints** in Azure ML Workspace:
